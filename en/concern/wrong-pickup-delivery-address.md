# What if the pickup and delivery address is wrong?
If you have an option to cancel the order then click on the cancel button else try to contact the selected laundry directly as soon as possible. Once you had posted job you can't edit the address, you need to cancel it and add new job. See [Cancel job](../application/cancel-job) and repeat order for more details.

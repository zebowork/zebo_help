# What i can't see bed sheet set?
Normally a bed sheet set can have multiple items depending on household to household. For example
1. Main sheet + 4 pillow cover + 4 cushion cover + Duvet cover
2. Main sheet + 2 pillow cover + 8 cushion cover + Duvet cover

You can see from above examples there is no standard, that is why you will not get accurate price. Plus in case of any of piece missed from laundry there will be not prove to track it back.

Best option is put all items separately in your basket. And we highly encourage you to put pictures with them. Example
1. Bedsheet 1
2. pillow cover 2
3. cushion cover 8
4. duvet cover 1
